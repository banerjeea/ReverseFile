# ReverseFile

This .Net Core console app is written in TDD approach which reverses a input text file. 

## Example:

### Input Text from input.txt:

```This is line one.```

```Second line.```

```Third line.```

### Output Generated in output.txt:

```.enil drihT```

```.enil dnoceS```

```.eno enil si sihT```

## Helpers:

Please add [these](https://github.com/banerjeea/ReverseFile/tree/master/HelperTextFiles) files to ```c:\temp``` to run the program. Due to time constraints, the program doesn't take file paths through user inputs.
